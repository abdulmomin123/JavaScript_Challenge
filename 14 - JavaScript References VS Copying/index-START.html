      // start with strings, numbers and booleans
      // let name = "jhalok";
      // let name2 = name;
      // console.log(name, name2);
      // name = "momin";
      // console.log(name, name2);

      // Let's say we have an array
      const players = ["Wes", "Sarah", "Ryan", "Poppy"];
      // const team = players;
      // console.log(players, team);
      // team[3] = "Momin";
      // console.log(players, team);

      // and we want to make a copy of it.

      // You might think we can just do something like this:

      // however what happens when we update that array?

      // now here is the problem!

      // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

      // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

      // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

      // one way
      const team2 = players.slice();
      // console.log(team2, players);
      // team2[3] = "Momin";
      // console.log(team2, players);

      // or create a new array and concat the old one in

      // or use the new ES6 Spread
      const team3 = [...players];
      // console.log(team3, players);
      // team3[3] = "Momin";
      // console.log(team3, players);

      // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

      // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

      // with Objects
      const person = {
        name: "Wes Bos",
        age: 80,
        socials: {
          facebook: "wesbos.developer",
          twitter: "@twitter",
        },
      };

      // and think we make a copy:

      // how do we take a copy instead?
      const person2 = Object.assign({}, person);
      // console.log(person2, person);
      // person2.age = 100;
      // console.log(person2, person);
      // !!only goes one level deep!!

      // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
      const person3 = { ...person };
      // console.log(person3, person);
      // person3.name = "Abdul Momin";
      // console.log(person3, person);

      // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
